<h3 align="center"> Selenium automates browsers. That's it! </h3>

What you do with that power is entirely up to you.
Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.
Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.


Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides an infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification — a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers.
The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.

<h4>Selenium WebDriver</h4> 
It is an open-source test automation tool that can be used efficiently for test automation. It is the market leader in test automation and proves to be very powerful in terms of automating application testing quickly. With the emergence of Agile and Scrum, Selenium WebDriver proves to be very efficient in reducing the iteration or sprint time, thus making it faster for the application to be made live.
